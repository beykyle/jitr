# just-in-time R-Matrix (jitR)
A fast calculable $\mathcal{R}$-matrix solver for parametric reaction models, production ready for calibration and uncertainty-quantification. Give your UQ workflow a caffeine-kick with jitR!


## quick start

```
 pip install jitr
```

The release versions of the package are hosted at [pypi.org/project/jitr/](https://pypi.org/project/jitr/).

## description
A framework for uncertainty-quantification of nuclear reaction observables using parametric reaction models. Consider a local coordinate-space potential $V(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})$ that is a function of some parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. Just write it like so:

```python
def V(r,*theta):
  a,b,c,... = theta
  # calculate and return potential at radial coordinate r as a function of parameters a,b,c,...
```

Then, you can pass it along with many samples of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ into jitR to calculate many samples of the corresponding cross sections for your system and reaction of interest!

Under the hood, jitR solves the radial Bloch-Shrödinger equation in the continuum using the calculable $\mathcal{R}$-Matrix method on a Lagrange-Legendre mesh. It is fast because it gives users the tools to precompute everything that they can for a system and reaction of interest, so given a single parameter sample, the minimal amount of compute is required to spit a cross section back out. For this reason, jitR is really suited to calculating an ensemble of observables for many parameter samples. Additionally, jitR relies on vectorized operations from [numpy](https://numpy.org/), as well as just-in-time (JIT) compilation from [`numba`](https://numba.pydata.org/) for the small subset of performance-critical code. 

The theory generally follows:

with the primary difference being that this code uses the energy-scaled version of the Bloch-Shrödinger equation, with dimensionless domain, $s = k_0 r$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate and $k_0$ is the entrance channel wavenumber.
